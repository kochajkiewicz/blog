Before I ever worked embedded on an Agile team with a distinctly backend focus, or served, dejected, on a product team in a sales-led org, I had the chance to  practice what has to be the worst design methodology out there.

"I won't get it done on time"

Whenever I feel the pace picking up, I think through what might happen when the thing I'm working on doesn't get delivered. Jot down each piece that makes up the thing. Prioritise those pieces.

"Looks like I have enough here"

Fear-driven design tricks us into believing that all the work has to be done at the same time. It tricks us into believing that there is such a thing as "done". It strips us of the opportunity to improve.
