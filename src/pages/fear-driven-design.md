Before I ever worked embedded on an Agile team with a distinctly backend focus, or served, dejected, on a product team in a sales-led org, I had the chance to  practice what has to be the worst design methodology out there.

"I won't get it done on time"

Whenever I feel the pace picking up and the thought pops into my head, I force myself to slow down. Imagine what happens when what I'm working on doesn't get delivered. Jot down each piece that makes up the thing I'm working on. Prioritise those.

It's not easy, but the alternative isn't worth it.
